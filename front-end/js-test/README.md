## Underground Challengue  
Write a function that will look at all of the London Underground stations and provide me with a list of stations whose letters will make up the alphabet.

**Example:** Picking "Acton Town" would mean the next station(s) in my report would need to contain the letters "b", "d", "e", "f", "g" "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "p", "q", "r", "s", "u", "v", "w, "x", "y", "z"

Then if "Bank" was picked we would get the "b" and "k" but not "a" and "n" because they were already picked from "Acton Town" 
Note: The number of stations returned in the query should be as low as possible.
