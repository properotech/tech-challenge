      <h1>Undergound Challenge</h1>

      <p>
        Write a function that will look at all of the London Underground
        stations and provide me with a list of stations whose letters will make
        up the alphabet.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Example:</b>
        Picking "Acton Town" would mean the next station(s) in my report would
        need to contain the letters "b", "d", "e", "f", "g" "h", "i", "j", "k",
        "l", "m", "p", "q", "r", "s", "u", "v", "w, "x", "y", "z"
      </p>

      <p>
        Then if "Bank" was picked we would get the "b" and "k" but not "a" and
        "n" because they were already picked from "Acton Town"
        <br />Note: The number of stations returned in the query should be as
        low as possible.
      </p>
